# Deep-Learning-Biology
The purpose of the project is to calculate the biding of different proteins to RNA sequences that are in the RNA-complete files. The project gets different files of the same protein and each file is a file of DNA sequences with different level of biding. 
The program gets as arguments diffrent files that is each file thar is diffrent DNA sequences that bind ata diffrent level to the protien the user want to check.
And using this files the programs create Using deep learning A NN that predicts the biding of an RNA sequence to the protein.
